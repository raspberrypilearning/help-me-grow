## Introduction

You are going to create a virtual pet, character or nature simulation that the user can interact with to help it grow. Your game will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Virtual pet games</span> are one type of game where users make things grow. You might have played with a small handheld Tamagotchi or played games like Catz and Adopt me on a computer. Can you think of any other virtual pet games?
</p>

You will:
+ Make a character or simulation that is fun or interesting to interact with
+ Use any combination of `variables`{:class="block3variables"}, `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} and `if`{:class="block3control"} blocks, with the skills you have already learned to allow a user to change a character
+ Understand how characters in games and apps are controlled by algorithms

### PROJECT BRIEF: Help me grow
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">
You need to create a virtual pet, character or nature simulation that the user can interact with to help it to grow or develop. You will use variables to keep track of how your main sprite is doing. It might be happy, bored, thirsty or sleepy. 

Your simulation should:
+ Use at least one variable to keep track of what the main sprite needs
+ Have a way for the variable(s) to change automatically
+ Give the user a way to improve the variables to help the main sprite grow

Your simulation could
+ Alert the user when levels are too high or low
+ Allow the user to set and change the name of their sprite 
+ Allow the user to chat with their sprite
+ Have an educational message such as kindness or keeping crops healthy

### Get inspiration

--- task ---
Think about what you will choose as a main sprite. It could be a pet that they user takes care of, a person that the user helps make good decisions, a plant or crop that the user helps to grow, or a nature or fantasy object that the user needs to create the right conditions for.
