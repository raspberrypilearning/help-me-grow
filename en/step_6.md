## Reflect

Did you meet the **project brief**? Think about your project and go through the checklist below and check off the ones that apply to your project.

Does your project have:

--- task ---
Use at least one `variable`{:class="block3variables"} to keep track of what the main sprite needs
--- /task ---
--- task ---
Have a way for the variable(s) to change automatically
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Give the user a way to improve the variables to give the main sprite what it needs.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Use `if`{:class="block3control"} blocks to control when things happen.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Use `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} blocks to communicate between other sprites and the main sprite.
--- /task ---

Your simulation could also have:

--- task ---
Have an educational message such as kindness or keeping crops healthy.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Alert the user when levels are too high or low.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Allow the user to chat with their sprite, or change its name.
--- /task ---

Reflecting about how you made your simulation will help you in your future projects:

--- task ---
How did you get your ideas?

What cool new thing(s) did you learn?

### Now you are the creator of a simulation!

Take a moment to celebrate what you have made.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Computer simulations</span> can allow us to experience situations that we couldn't in real life. There are computer simulations that allow surgeons to practice operations. There are simulations that allow space engineers to predict what will happen when they launch a rocket and make changes to the variables to see what happens. And there are game simulations that allow you to take care of a pet or simulation a person, family or job.

Where will you take your new powers? What simulation will you make next?
