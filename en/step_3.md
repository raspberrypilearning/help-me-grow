## Build and test

Now it's time to make your project. Start small, and add more to your project if you have time.

**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

You will need to decide in what order to build your project. You could:

+ Create one variable and allow the user to control it and add animations, costumes, sound and effects and conversation to make the sprite really come to life 
+ Create multiple variables with simple ways for the user to control them, and then add more effects later.

Adding a sprite and then creating a `variable`{:class="block3variables"} is a great start.
