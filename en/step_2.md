## Your idea

Use this step to plan your virtual pet, character or nature simulation. The user will need to be able to create the right conditions for the main sprite to 'grow'. Your main sprite might actually get bigger but it could just 'grow' in terms of experience or health.

You can plan by just thinking; tinkering; drawing or writing; or however you like!

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Personal growth</span> means learning ways of thinkking. People need a safe and healthy environment and opportunities to learn and practice. Having a <span style="color: #0faeb0">growth mindset</span> means that you understand that your abilities can improve over time.

### Why are you making ... ?

--- task ---

Think about the purpose of your project. 

It could be:
- To teach someone how to do something, such as look after a guinea pig or keep a plant alive.  
- To share an educational message, such as looking after your mental health or looking after your neighbourhood.
- To entertain users by giving them something they wouldn't usually get the chance to grow.

### Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your project for (your **audience**). 

Knowing your audience will help you design a project they will want to play again and again.

What will your **main** sprite be? 
+ A character such as a pet or wild animal, or a person,
+ A plant or crop that needs sunlight, water and nutrients,
+ A feature from science or nature, such as a rainbow or a fire,
+ A machine, such as a submarine or a recycling machine,
+ Or something else

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Think about your **main** sprite and decide:

+ What objects and `variables`{:class="block3variables"} might be needed.
+ Will the `variables`{:class="block3variables"} change over time, for example hunger or tiredness increasing every few seconds.
+ How will the user interact with the main sprite? This could be clicking on food to feed an animal or chatting with a character to reduce their boredom.
