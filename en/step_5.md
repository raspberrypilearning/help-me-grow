## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas to add more already or you might want to go back to the first step and look at other projects again for more inspiration.

You could:
- Add more `variables`{:class="block3variables"} that represent things your main sprite wants or needs.
- Check more **conditions** using `if`{:class="block3control"} statements and make your sprite do different things depending on whether the condition is true or false.
- Add more sprites that can be used to interact with your main sprite such as buttons or toys.
- Add animations using `graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"} or costumes.
- Add more `sound effects`{:class="block3sounds"}.

## Get inspiration

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a ‘See Inside’ link for you to open the project in Scratch and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.

Take a look at some This sprite needs you projects created by community members in the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s studio of 'This sprite needs you - Community' projects [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29722869/){:target="_blank"}.

## Small improvements

When you make a Scratch project there are lots of ways to make sure you've done a really good job.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Marginal gains</span> are small upgrades that don't make much difference on their own but when added together they make a big improvement to the quality of your work and speed you can make more changes.

Can you use marginal gains to change one thing now that will help you in future? Things to do:

+ Name all sprites, costumes, sounds, variables and messages sensibly. It's much easier to understand projects that use helpful names.
+ Fill in the Project Page with a good title, instructions and notes so that users know how to use your project and where you got ideas from.
+ Add short comments that explain what your code is doing
+ Make sure your scripts are tidy in the 'Code' tab. You can right-click and choose 'Clean up Blocks' or arrange the scripts in a way that makes sense to you. Try and put similar scripts together.
