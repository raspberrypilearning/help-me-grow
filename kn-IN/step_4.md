## Checklist

**project brief** ಭೇಟಿ ಮಾಡಿದ್ದೀರಾ? Think about your project and go through the checklist below. Check off the ones that apply to your project.

Does your project:

--- task ---

Use at least one `variable`{:class="block3variables"} to keep track of what the main sprite needs

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Have a way for the variable(s) to change automatically

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Give the user a way to improve the variables to give the main sprite what it needs

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Use `if`{:class="block3control"} blocks to control when things happen

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Use `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} blocks to communicate between other sprites and the main sprite

--- /task ---

Your simulation could also:

--- task ---

Have an educational message, such as kindness or keeping crops healthy

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Alert the user when levels are too high or low

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Allow the user to chat with their sprite, or change its name

--- /task ---

Reflect on how you made your simulation to help you in your future projects:

--- task ---

ನಿಮ್ಮ ವಿಚಾರಗಳನ್ನು ನೀವು ಹೇಗೆ ಪಡೆದುಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದೀರಿ?

ನೀವು ಯಾವ ಹೊಸ ವಿಷಯಗಳನ್ನು ಕಲಿತಿದ್ದೀರಿ?

### Now you are the creator of a simulation!

ನೀವು ಮಾಡಿದ್ದನ್ನು ಸಂಭ್ರಮಿಸಲು ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ ಸಮಯ ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಳ್ಳಿ.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Computer simulations</span> can allow us to experience situations that we couldn't in real life. There are computer simulations that allow surgeons to practice operations. There are simulations that allow space engineers to predict what will happen when they launch a rocket, and make changes to the variables to see what happens. And there are game simulations that allow you to take care of a pet, person, family, or job.
