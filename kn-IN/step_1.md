## You will make

Create a virtual pet, character, or nature simulation that the user can interact with to help it. Your game will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Virtual pet games</span> are one type of game where users interact with characters to meet the characters' needs. You might have played with a small handheld Tamagotchi or enjoyed games like Catz and Adopt me! on a computer. Can you think of any other virtual pet games?
</p>

‡≤®‡≥Ä‡≤µ‡≥Å:
+ Make a character or simulation that is fun or interesting to interact with
+ Use any combination of `variables`{:class="block3variables"}, `broadcast`{:class="block3events"}, and `if`{:class="block3control"} blocks, with the skills you have already learnt, to allow a user to meet the needs of a character
+ Understand how characters in games and apps are controlled by algorithms

### Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 

Interact with Cricket the bat. What happens if you click on the food or water sprites? How can you tell if the bat is hungry or thirsty?

### PROJECT BRIEF: Help me grow
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">
You need to create a virtual pet, plant, or other simulation that the user can interact with to meet its needs. You will use **variables** to keep track of how your main sprite is doing. It might be happy, bored, thirsty, or sleepy. 

Your simulation should:
+ Use at least one `variable`{:class="block3variables"} to keep track of what the main sprite needs
+ Have a way for the variable(s) to change automatically
+ Give the user a way to improve the variables to give the main sprite what it needs
+ Use `if`{:class="block3control"} blocks to control when things happen
+ Use `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} blocks to communicate between other sprites and the main sprite

Your simulation could:
+ Have a message, such as kindness or keeping crops healthy
+ Alert the user when levels are too high or low
+ Allow the user to chat with their sprite, or change its name

‚≠ê Share your finished This sprite needs you project for a chance of it being featured here.

Think about what you will choose as a main sprite. It could be a pet that the user cares for, a person that the user helps make good decisions, a plant or crop that the user helps to grow, or a nature or fantasy object that the user needs to create the right conditions for.
