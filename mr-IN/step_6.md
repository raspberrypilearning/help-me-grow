Now is the time to share your simulation so that users can try it.

If you have a Scratch account, you can share your project through Scratch. Check with an adult first. You can send a link to people you know, and the whole Scratch community will be able to find your project to try it out. Make sure you fill in the **Instructions** section, so that users know what they need to do to help your main sprite.

Why not invite your friends to create a project? Let them know how you had fun.

If you have a Scratch account, and have shared your project, keep an eye out for comments that others may make about your creation. Feedback is a great way to reflect on your work. Report and ignore any comments that are unhelpful or irrelevant.
