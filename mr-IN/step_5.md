## Challenge

तुमच्याकडे वेळ असल्यास, तुम्ही तुमचा प्रोजेक्ट अपग्रेड करू शकता. You might have ideas to add more already, or you might want to go back to the first step and look at other projects again for more inspiration.

--- task ---

Add more `variables`{:class="block3variables"} that represent things your main sprite wants or needs.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Check more **conditions** using `if`{:class="block3control"} statements, and make your sprite do different things depending on whether the condition is true or false.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add more sprites that can be used to interact with your main sprite, such as buttons or toys.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add animations using `graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"} or costumes.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add more `sound effects`{:class="block3sound"}

--- /task ---

## प्रेरणा मिळवा

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a ‘See Inside’ link for you to open the project in Scratch, look at the code to get ideas, and see how they work.

Take a look at some projects created by community members in the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s **This sprite needs you - Community** [studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29722869/){:target="_blank"}.

## Small improvements

Can you change a few things now that will help you in future?

--- task ---

Name all sprites, costumes, sounds, variables, and messages sensibly.

It's much easier to understand projects that use helpful names.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Fill in the Project Page with a good title, instructions, and notes, so that users know how to use your project, and where you got ideas from.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add short comments that explain what your code is doing.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Make sure your scripts are tidy in the **Code** tab. You can right-click and choose **Clean up Blocks** or arrange the scripts in a way that makes sense to you. Try and put similar scripts together.
