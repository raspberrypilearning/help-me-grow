## तुमची कल्पना

Plan your virtual pet, character, or nature simulation. The user will have to create the right conditions to support the main sprite's needs. Your main sprite might get bigger, gain experience, increase health, or something else.

You can plan by just thinking, tinkering, drawing or writing, or however you like!

When <span style="color: #0faeb0">basic needs</span> like food and safety are met, we are creating the right conditions for creatures (including ourselves) to learn and grow. So the next time you’re feeling cranky or distracted, check your basic needs.

### Why are you making your project?

--- task ---

Think about the **purpose** of your project.

हे असू शकते:
- To teach a new skill, such as looking after an animal or keeping a plant alive
- To share a message, such as look after your mental health or improve your neighbourhood
- To entertain users, by giving them something they wouldn't usually get the chance to interact with

### Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your project for (your **audience**).

Knowing your audience will help you design a project they will want to play again and again.

What will your **main** sprite be?
+ A character such as a pet or wild animal, or a person
+ A plant or crop that needs sunlight, water, and nutrients
+ A feature from science or nature, such as a rainbow or a fire
+ A machine, such as a submarine or a recycling machine
+ Or something else

Think about your **main** sprite and decide:

+ What objects and `variables`{:class="block3variables"} might be needed?
+ Will the `variables`{:class="block3variables"} change over time, for example hunger or tiredness increasing every few seconds?
+ How will the user interact with the main sprite? This could be clicking on food to feed an animal, or chatting with a character to reduce their boredom.

--- task ---

Give your project a title that tells the user what to expect, and makes them want to try it out.

The example projects were: **Bat simulator**, **Make a rainbow**, **Watermelon farmer**, and **Music Machine**.

You can always update the title later if you think of a better one.
